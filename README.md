In a frontend-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game, the UI is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive experience.

HTML: Defines buttons for "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors," along with sections to display the player's choice, computer's choice, and the result.
CSS: Styles the buttons, layout, and animations to make the game visually appealing.
JavaScript: Implements game logic, randomly selects the computer’s move, determines the winner based on the rules, updates the UI dynamically, and provides real-time feedback.
